A google homepage project using HTML and CSS

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This project is an excercise in learning CSS grid. Other techniques learned to build this include :hover and :focus selectors and refactoring for more condensed code. A future addition could be to add Google's App button with the hidden menu.
